- **Kotlin Multiplatform**: Sharing code between different platforms.

### My Expertise

Here are some of the technologies I am proficient in:

- **Kotlin**: My go-to programming language for Android development.
- **MVVM**: Architecture pattern that enhances the separation of concerns.
- **Room**: Database library for local data storage.
- **Retrofit**: HTTP client for making API requests.
